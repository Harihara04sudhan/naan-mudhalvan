****Object Detection in Bangladeshi Road Conditions****
**Overview:**
    This project focuses on developing solutions for object detection in various road conditions across Bangladesh. The dataset consists of 9825 images captured under real-world conditions using smartphone cameras, covering diverse road types such as towns, expressways, highways, and village roads. Annotations are provided for 13 classes including auto rickshaws, bicycles, cars, and pedestrians.
